            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my electronic portfolio. I am a current Junior at Waipahu High School, studying Cybersecurity, hoping one day I'll get a job for coding or maybe computer hardware / software work. My goals and objectives for the future are to get my dream job and be able to give back to my family and community. I am very invested in teamwork skills, as which is why I joined sports to get to know others better by being part of their community.</p>
